# Promises

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It is a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations than traditional callback functions, providing a cleaner and more manageable approach to working with asynchronous code.
