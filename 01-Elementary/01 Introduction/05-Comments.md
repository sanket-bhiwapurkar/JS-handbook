# JavaScript Comments

JavaScript comments are annotations or notes within the code that are intended for developers to read, but they are ignored by the compiler or interpreter during code execution.

JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

### Single Line Comments

```JS
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
```

### Multi-line Comments

```JS
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```
