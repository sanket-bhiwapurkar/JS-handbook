# Break and Continue

## The Break Statement

You have already seen the break statement used in an Conditional Statements. It was used to "jump out" of a switch() statement.

The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop:

Example

```JS
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
if (i === 3) { break; }
text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

In the example above, the break statement ends the loop ("breaks" the loop) when the loop counter (i) is 3.

## The Continue Statement

The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

This example skips the value of 3:

Example

```JS
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
if (i === 3) { continue; }
text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```
